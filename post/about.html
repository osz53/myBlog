                <p> That I created this site with the intention of pushing my
                    alternative rock propaganda. I have always enjoyed rock music
                    but since I live in Nigeria it is almost impossible to see my 
                    favourite rock bands perform live, this has troubled me a lot lately
                    so I decided to create this website with the hope of finding people with
                    similar interest. I am hoping to find as rock fans as possible, at least
                    enough to persuade Mumford & Sons, The Script and even Imagine Dragons to come to Nigeria (pipe dream? yes, no, maybe, 
                    I don't know...), I know they visit South Africa so why can't they come to
                    Nigeria?
                </p>

                <p>
                   I have to tell you this, I also created this site to practise HTML and CSS. I
                   graduated with a very beautiful degree and now I want to switch career,
                    you know, I'm sure you know someone like me, so I beg you to bear with me if this
                    site is not user friendly or below industry standard, I am trying my best and I plan 
                    on improving things on this site from time to time; I am open to your suggestions, ideas
                    and correction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you choose to continue visiting this site you would be exposing 
                    yourself to my ideas and opinions, things like: movies, 
                    photography, my embarassing attempt at poetry, music, programming, football,
                    science and dinning table philosophy. The goodnews is that you might enjoy 
                    them and even if you don't you would be a witness to my attempt to bring rock 
                    bands to Nigeria.
                </p>
