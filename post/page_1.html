            <h3 class="post_title">Why you should choose life</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Last week I saw a movie, <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a></i>, the movie
                    was released in 1996, starring Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan
                    from Star wars). Trainspotting is a novel about heroin 
                    addicts that was adapted into a movie. I was entertained, everything
                    was perfect from the amazing soundtrack to the tiny jokes sprinkled through
                    out the movie, I consider it a masterpiece, at least for the soundtrack alone.
                    It wasn't all jokes and laughter though, I learnt valuable lessons about
                    drug addiction, friendship and family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ewan McGregor's character "Rent boy" delivered a monologue "choose life",
                    I can tell you that reading does not carry the same effect as hearing Rent boy recite the lines
                    with his beautiful scottish accent.

                        "Choose life. Choose a job.
                         Choose a career. Choose a family. 
                         Choose a fucking big television, 
                        Choose washing machines, cars, 
                        compact disc players, 
                        and electrical tin can openers.
                        Choose good health, 
                        low cholesterol and dental insurance. 
                        Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. 
                        Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. 
                        Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. 
                        Choose a three piece 
                        suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. 
                        Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning. 
                        Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing spirit-crushing game shows, 
                        stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. 
                        Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable home, 
                        nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats 
                        you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. 
                        Choose life . . . But why would I want to do a thing like that? 
                        I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? 
                        There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you’ve got heroin?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nah? you don't feel it? check out the choose life monologue
                    our very own Rent boy (or man) delivered in the sequel of
                    Trainspotting released in 2017

                <p class="quote">
                        "Choose life
                        Choose Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and hope that someone, somewhere cares
                        Choose looking up old flames, wishing you’d done it all differently
                        And choose watching history repeat itself
                        Choose your future
                        Choose reality TV, slut shaming, revenge porn
                        Choose a zero hour contract, a two hour journey to work
                        And choose the same for your kids, only worse, and smother the pain with an unknown dose of an unknown drug made in somebody’s kitchen
                        And then… take a deep breath
                        You’re an addict, so be addicted
                        Just be addicted to something else
                        Choose the ones you love
                        Choose your future
                        Choose life"
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know right? it is shorter and more relatable. 
                    If you ever find yourself in a position where you have to
                    choose between life and something else, choose life because
                    it is better than heroin and nothing is better than heroin
                    (that's what Renton said). Say no to drugs and try to make pro-life
                    decisions everyday.
