            <article>
                <P>
                    The first time I came across this poem was when I was
                    watching an episode from the second season of Fargo and the 
                    second time was when I was reading GEB: an rternal golden braid. 
                    It is no coincidence that it appears that Jabberwocky appears in GEB and Fargo
                    as both of them point at the absurdity of life,
                    and this wonderful poem does the same to words and the meaning we
                    think they carry. This poem paints a vivid picture using nonsensical
                    words as its brush. 
                </P>

                <p> Enjoy!</p>

                        ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
                        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
                  All mimsy were the borogoves, 
                        And the mome raths outgrabe. 
                  
                  “Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
                        The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
                  Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
                        The frumious Bandersnatch!” 
                  
                  He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
                        Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
                  So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
                        And stood awhile in thought. 
                  
                  And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
                        The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
                  Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
                        And burbled as it came! 
                  
                  One, two! One, two! And through and through 
                        The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
                  He left it dead, and with its head 
                        He went galumphing back. 
                  
                  “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
                        Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
                  O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
                        He chortled in his joy. 
                  
                  ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
                        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
                  All mimsy were the borogoves, 
                        And the mome raths outgrabe.
